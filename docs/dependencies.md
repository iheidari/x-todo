## [reset-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reset-css):
An unmodified* copy of Eric Meyer's [CSS reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).

The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
